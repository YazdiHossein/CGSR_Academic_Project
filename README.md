The Brief description for the CGSR Report about Tesco Scandal:

ASSIGNMENT DETAILS
The Tesco Reporting Scandal

Tesco, a supermarket chain, was found to have overstated it profits in 2014 by 
£263m after revenue recognition irregularities were spotted in its half-year results, 
with regulators including the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) set to decide on a 
suitable punishment. It took 5 years for the investigations to end and Tesco was fined 
heavily. 
The supermarket originally predicted its then half-year trading profit would be around 
£1.1bn, but this figure has now been cut back by £263m – originally £250m. Tesco 
had subsequently launched a review of the figures to find out why its first half profit 
prediction was so inflated.
